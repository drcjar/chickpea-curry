# Workers' curry (Chana masala)
 
## Makes enough for 4 people
 
- 200g dried chickpeas or 6x 400g tins of chickpeas
- 9cm ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped
- 1 fresh green chilli, roughly chopped
- salt
- 3 tbsp rapeseed oil
- 4 onions, sliced
- 4 x 400g tin of good quality plum tomatoes
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- 1 teaspoon garam masala will bring spices from home
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chilli powder
- 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric

Rinse and drain chickpeas. 

Pound the ginger, garlic, and green chilli together in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of salt until it turns into a 
paste.

Put the oil into a large frying pan on a medium heat. When it's hot, add the onions and cook for 10 or 12 minutes, or until
golden brown. Don't skimp on time and stir frequently. When the onions have coloured, add the ginger, garlic and chilli paste 
and stir through. Tip in the tomatoes, crushing them with your other hand before they hit the pan. Add the tomatoe puree, stir
well and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it becomes a thick rich sauce.

Add garam masala, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of salt, cumin, chilli powder and tumeric, and cook for a couple of minutes before adding
chickpeas. Check consistency. I like to add around 5 or more tablespoons of water at this point, to thin the sauce a little.
Stir well and cook for another 5 minutes. Taste and adjust any seasoning as you require.
